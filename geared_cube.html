			<p>I originally saw this idea of a geared cube over at Thingiverse and I saw a mechanical version of it where the user can crank a shaft to rotate the cube. I wanted to automate this and make it electrical where the speed is constant. At the time, I was also starting to learn how to use Arduino and I wanted to challenge myself to learn how to use other microcontrollers at a fraction of the size. This really challenged me since I didn’t really know anything about electrical components. I would say this was my first real Arduino project and I am proud of it. I learned how to program, solder, and interface electronics with physical systems.</p>
		</div>
		<h1>How It's Made</h1>
		<div class="content-text">
			<p>The first problem that had to be solved was modifying the pre-existing .STL files to work with my custom parts. I designed the additional geometry I wanted to add to the pre-existing part in Fusion 360 and then merged the two parts in Meshmixer to create a single .STL file. Only two parts were modified using these steps which are the central shaft piece and the stationary platform puzzle piece. The other parts of the gear cube were left unmodified and additional components for interfacing the electronics with the cube were designed in Fusion 360.</p>
			<p>The next big challenge was learning how to program, wire, and power the Attiny85 and interface it with the stepper motor. Although the wiring and programming is easy for any experienced tinkerer, not having any experience with electrical and programming concepts made it difficult for me to understand what I was doing. Once I learned how stepper motors work and how to program them, I moved onto programming the Attiny85, which took forever to get it working on its own. One of the components I was missing was a single capacitor for programming the Attiny85. I didn’t want to buy a set of capacitors, so I ended up driving to Fry’s Electronics to buy a kit that contained a capacitor. Probably one of my dumbest ideas but I was determined. Soldering the Attiny85 was also very difficult since I bought a low-end soldering iron that came with cheap solder and that’s it. No additional mechanical hands or tip tinner or fan or anything. Unluckily for my sister, I needed her hands to help me solder the parts directly onto the pins of the Attiny85. Because my soldering job was atrocious being it was my first time ever soldering, I added hot glue to the pins of the Attiny85 to prevent wire bending and potential detachment.</p>
			<p>An issue that bothered me was that the cube gear was very difficult to turn due to small tolerances requirements while using a low-end 3D printer such as mine. This caused the cube gear to be very difficult to turn to the point where the small stepper motor was unable to turn the cube. I resolved this issue in 3 ways:</p>
		</div>
		<ol>
			<li>Print longer pegs that prevented the faces of the gears to touch the central shaft piece</li>
			<li>Sand and lubricate the model faces with lithium grease</li>
			<li>Increase the gear ratio between the input and output gear</li>
		</ol>
		<div class="content-text">
			<p>A combination of all 3 of these implementations created a cohesive and easy to rotate desk trinket. The best part is that it's powered via USB.</p>
