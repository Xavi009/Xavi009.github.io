		<h1>What is this?</h1>
		<p>During the summer between my junior and senior year of high school (summer 2016), I was a geology-oriented research intern at the University of San Diego (USD). During the internship, I aided in collecting soil samples for geological research in the upper San Diego area under the supervision of my mentors. I was also able to conduct my own experiment on arsenic concentrations in Black Mountain due to an abandoned arsenic mine from the 40s. My internship culminated into a research poster I was able to present at my high school.</p>

		<h1>Sampling the Upper San Diego Soil</h1>
		<p>For the 1st half of my internship, I took various geogenic (or naturally occurring) soil samples from various locations around San Diego. The goal was to expand on Professor Cathcart’s soil database of San Diego to eventually create maps of San Diego’s soil and soil layers. This process involved going to different sites in San Diego (this could be in a ditch outside someone’s hose or going hiking), looking for prime spots to sample potentially untouched geogenic soil. The sample was then labelled based on its geographical location and potential soil type and GPS coordinates were recorded. After a long day of collecting samples, the samples are processed by first crushing any large rocks in a rock crusher until a fine grain is achieved. All tools are decontaminated prior to use using acetone to avoid introduction of additional elements.</p>

			</div>
		</div>
		<p>Once the samples were processed, the soil was analyzed using an x-ray fluorescence (XRF) machine. This machine analyzes the concentrations of naturally occurring elements in a given soil sample. The data was then processed in Excel to highlight trends and configured to transfer to the master spreadsheet. Using the GPS coordinates of different soil types/layers, a map of soil layers of San Diego can be produced. This work benefits communities since sampling soil provides insight on potential environmental hazards human interference with nature can have. Sampling random locations in San Diego also provides insight into the city’s past.</p>

		<h1>Research on Black Mountain</h1>
		<p>For the 2nd half of my internship, I was under the guidance of Professor O’Shea’s mentorship. She is a distinguished geologist and researcher and has devoted most of her research to the study of arsenic in soil and how arsenic can disrupt our water supplies. At the time, Professor O’Shea had centered her focus on an abandoned arsenic mine built in the 40s in Black Mountain. Although the arsenic mine was out of sight and difficult to access, trails running near the mine expose visitors to soil with disproportionately high levels of arsenic. More importantly, recent housing developments near the base of the mountain run the risk of also being exposed to high levels of arsenic if it rains. When exposed to water, arsenic in soil becomes very mobile and is easily transported which can be absorbed by plants we consume.</p>

		<p>My research involved analyzing the effects of varying concentrations of arsenic on plants. To begin, I collected soil samples at varying distances from the mouth of the arsenic mine and labelled each group from A to D (A being the closest to the mine and D being the furthest). A control soil sample was taken a great distance from the mine. Samples were not collected from within the mine as the soil was composed of ~40% arsenic, which is extremely dangerous. For the sake of comparison, the FDA allowable concentration of arsenic in water is 10 ppm and the mine contained 40,000 ppm. This part of the experiment was fun and horrible at the same time since I was collecting dirt in jeans, long sleeve shirt, and mask in 90 degree weather. I also had to backpack all the soil I collected, which made for a painful but rewarding hike. Soil samples were analyzed using an XRF machine to identify concentrations of arsenic and were potted. Miner’s lettuce seeds were planted in 50mL of each soil. These plants were selected since they are native to the area and were consumed by the miners back in the day. Three samples of each soil type were planted for a total of 15 samples. Samples were given 30mL of deionized water every week.</p>

		<p>The effects of arsenic were relatively objective as they were based on plant growth characteristics. This involved measuring the stem length, width of the biggest leaf, and length of the longest leaf. Additional observations were measured on the soil such as the porosity of each soil. Measurements were taken every other day. Something that I was unable to accomplish was measuring arsenic concentrations in water after watering the plants. This would give further insight on the “leachability” of arsenic and how easily it flows with water. Water samples were collected using pore water samplers.</p>
		<p>After 3 weeks of collecting data, a general trend of plant degradation due to arsenic introduction was observed. Throughout the experiment, all plants developed at nearly the same rate. After 16 days of planting seeds, the control group’s plants appeared greener and had fuller looking leaves in comparison to the arsenic-rich soils. After 30 days of planting, 3 out of the 15 plants died while the remaining plants, except for the control group, were wilting. Although the plants in soils with less arsenic performed better, the difference in effectiveness is negligible since the control group’s leaves only grew a millimeter more than the others.</p>
