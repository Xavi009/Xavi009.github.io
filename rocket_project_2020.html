		<h1>1. What is this?</h1>
		<p>In 2019, Bearospace @ UCLA achieved <a href="rocket_project_2019.html">first place in NASA's First Nations Launch</a> (FNL). Following this success, Bearospace applied and was accepted to NASA Student Launch (formerly known as University Student Launch Initiative, or USLI). USLI is a research-based, competitive, high-powered rocketry competition focused primarily on developing unique payload systems. It strives to provide, relevant, cost-effective research and development of current objectives/problems faced by the Artemis program. Unlike FNL, USLI is not limited to minorities, nor does it provide funding for teams. USLI is a more competitive and higher caliber student project. I encourage you to read the <a href="#context&struggles">Context & Struggles</a> section to better understand the scope and effort USLI meant for the Bearospace team.</p>
		<h2>1.1. Relevant Requirements</h2>
		<p>This year's unique payload criteria was to design a system capable of being launched in a high power rocket, landing safely, and recovering simulated lunar ice from one of several locations on the surface of the launch field. Important high-level payload design requirements are presented below:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Five recovery areas will be located on the surface of the launch field. Teams may recover a sample from any of the recovery areas. Each recovery site will be at least 3 feet in diameter and contain sample material extending from ground level to at least 2 inches below the surface.</li>
			<li>The recovered ice sample will be a minimum of 10 milliliters (mL).</li>
			<li>Once the sample is recovered, it must be stored and transported at least 10 linear feet from the recovery area.</li>
			<li>Teams must abide by all FAA and NAR rules and regulations.</li>
			<li>Black Powder and/or similar energetics are only permitted for deployment of in-flight recovery systems. Any ground deployments must utilize mechanical systems.</li>
			<li>Any part of the payload or vehicle that is designed to be deployed, whether on the ground or in the air, must be fully retained until it is deployed as designed.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Additional general, vehicle, recovery, and safety requirements are outlined in the manual but are not as applicable to my role so they will not be discussed.</p>

		<h1>2. My Roles & Tasks</h1>
		<p>Because of the extreme lack of members between the previous year and this year, I was formally known as both the electronics lead and the payloads lead. To some degree, this dual role made it easier to collaborate between the electronics and the payloads team since I was essentially both teams, but the workload was still twice as much. After recruiting freshman, I had a sizeable team of 5 on the electronics team but only me on the payloads team. Below is a snippet of the work I managed to complete before COVID-19 halted progress.</p>

		<h2>2.1. Payload</h2>
		<p>As the payloads lead, I was responsible for designing, manufacturing, and mechanically testing the payload and its associated deployment method. This meant a lot of SolidWorks, 3D printing, CNC milling and modifying commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components. Each dimension was iteratively modified during the R&D phase of manufacturing. As the only member of the payloads team, I spent almost all my time in the machine shop, either starting 3D prints or CNC milling wooden components.</p>
		<div class="w3-row">
			<div class="w3-col l12 m12 s12">
				<img class="image-gal" style="max-width: 550px;" src="pictures/rocket20/Entire Assembly.PNG">
			</div>	
		</div>
		<p>The payload design features two functional components:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The Rover Ejection Assembly (REA)</li>
			<li>The Rover</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The rover ejection assembly is tasked with retaining and deploying the rover in the correct orientation after a landing event has been identified. Once deployed, the payload will begin radio frequency communication with a driver on the ground. The rover will receive inputs from the driver and return video feedback to the driver to complete the mission.</p>

		<h3>2.1.1. Rover Ejection Assembly (REA)</h3>
		<div class="w3-row">
			<div class="w3-col l12 m12 s12">
				<img class="image-gal" style="max-width: 650px;" src="pictures/rocket20/Ejection System Assembly.PNG">
			</div>	
		</div>
		<p>Using the above figure as reference, the leftmost stepper motor (1) is attached to a bulkhead (3) using epoxy. This stepper motor connects to the entire assembly to rotate the payload. Attaching the motor to the entire assembly makes the motor a load bearing component. A large moment will be induced on the stepper motor from the protruding rods and payload resting on the rods. To prevent this, an additional aluminum alloy bearing ring (4) will be used. The bearing ring will support the entire assembly so that the leftmost stepper motor will only rotate the assembly, not support it. All load bearing forces will be applied to the bearing ring. Since the purchased bearing ring is flat, additional 3D printed rings (2 & 6) are placed to offset one rotating ring from the other. These standoff rings interface with the bearing ring and the bulkhead or circular block holder (7). A circular tube (5) will fit around the shaft of the stepper motor and will be epoxied into the large circular block holder (7). The circular block holder acts as a rotating bulkhead for which to attach the rods and additional stepper motor onto. Cutouts for another stepper motor, a gyroscope/accelerometer module, and a steel rod are provided. The unthreaded rod (9) and stepper motor (1) will be epoxied into the designated hole inside the circular block holder. In order to attach the lead screw (10) onto the stepper motor, a 5mm to 10mm coupling (9) will be used. The coupling allows two shafts of different diameters to be attached by adjusting the force applied on each using screws. Both the lead screw and unthreaded rod are ⅜" in diameter to provide enough rigidity to support the weight of the payload.</p>
		<p>A unique aspect of the rover deployment mechanism is the circular block holder (7). Dimensions of each cut were dictated by the size of the stepper motor, interference with the eyebolt attached to the bulkhead, and size constraints imposed by the rover ebay. A concern with the shape of the circular block holder was its thin wall size for housing the stepper motor compromising the overall strength of the retention system and how protrusion of the stepper motor outside the boundary of the circular block holder outer diameter clashes with the eyebolt if driven the wrong way. The following figure demonstrates the reasoning for the circular block holder.</p>
		<div class="w3-row">
			<div class="w3-col l12 m12 s12">
				<img class="image-gal" style="max-width: 400px;" src="pictures/rocket20/Rotation Part.PNG">
			</div>	
		</div>
		<p>The diameter of the circular block holder allots space for the leftmost eyebolt (which is used for the launch vehicle's parachute), however, this means part of the stepper motor is exposed. If rotated counterclockwise, the stepper motor will interfere with the eyebolt, which jeopardizes the deployment mechanism’s ability to orient the rover. Moving the motor and shaft towards the center would mitigate this problem, but would limit the space available for electronics onboard the rover.</p>

		<h3>2.1.2. Rover</h3>
		<div class="w3-row">
			<div class="w3-col l6 m6 s12">
				<img class="image-gal" src="pictures/rocket20/Rover Assembly 1.PNG">

			</div>
		</div>
		<p>The payload features a 11.4" x 4.3" x 4.2" rover with a collapsible collection arm and antenna for storage within the launch vehicle. A 2.3" x 1.9" x 0.4" (~28.6mL) storage area within the chassis of the rover will store simulated lunar ice samples. The same collection arm doubles as a cap for the collection bin to ensure collected samples are retained within the rover during transportation. A separate 2.4" x 3.0" x 4.0" compartmentalized section, located on the back side of the rover, is dedicated to housing all onboard electronics. A requirement in the USLI handbook states that all lithium polymer batteries must be sufficiently protected and marked as flammable. To satisfy this requirement, the single lithium polymer battery powering onboard electronics is located in a separate, bright red compartment within the electronics bay. All other electronics are placed on the top half of the electronics bay for easier access to electronics. Both compartments and lid are fastened to each other using 6-32 nuts and bolts. The bottom red compartment of the ebay is attached to the chassis using epoxy. The contact area between the chassis and the bottom ebay compartment is maximized to increase the amount of epoxy applied between the two parts. The rover uses wheels instead of treads as its form of movement. While this limits the rover’s ability to overcome obstacles located under its center, the driver will take extra precaution in avoiding obstacles.</p>

				<img class="image-gal" style="max-width: 600px;" src="pictures/rocket20/Rover Exploded.JPG">
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>A crucial component for deploying the rover and managing electronics onboard the rover is the electronics bay (7 & 8). Since the electronics bay interfaces with the deployment mechanism’s rods, the electronics bay must support the weight of the rover and landing impact forces while stored within the launch vehicle. A custom printed female threaded rod (10) interfaces with the threaded rod of the REA. A small camera is mounted on top of the payload on component (9) for video feedback. Additional design considerations were critical for all components but will be omitted for brevity.</p>

		<h2>2.2. Electronics</h2>
		<p>As the electronics lead, I was responsible for creating electrical systems for 3 main tasks/sections:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>REA</li>
			<li>Rover</li>
			<li>Altimeters & GPS</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>2.2.1. REA</h3>
		<p>In order to orient and deploy the rover after launch, the rover ejection assembly employs a series of electronics to autonomously accomplish this. This bypasses the challenge of establishing a fickle surface RF communication between the team and the launch vehicle and removes the need of additional antennas. The individual components are discussed in the following sections.</p>

		<p>Since the rover must be autonomously deployed, the Arduino microcontroller must be able to identify when a touchdown event has occurred after launch. The BMP and accelerometer/gyroscope modules help the Arduino Uno decide when to deploy. The following flow chart illustrates the steps taken by the Arduino Uno for safe deployment.</p>

				<li><b><i>Apogee:</i></b> the Arduino code will define apogee as the highest point after reaching an arming altitude of 1000 ft higher than the calibrated ground level altitude. This allows the Arduino to differentiate between when the launch vehicle is on the pad and when it has landed.</li>

		<h3>2.2.2. Rover</h3>
		<p>Rover electronics were selected from commercially available drone parts for their small form factor, compatibility with well known components, and high-powered RF capabilities. An Arduino Uno is much larger than the selected flight controller used which made this option an attractive one. This ended up being a huge mistake as the team was not able to program the system to better fit the team’s needs. A better solution would be to use dual in-line package (DIP) chip microcontrollers and wire all necessary peripherals and components to a perfboard. This would allow greater control over the designed system in terms of hardware and software while remaining relatively small enough to fit within the payload.</p>
		<p>Nonetheless, the selected components and schematic are presented below.</p>

		<h3>2.2.3. Verification & Testing</h3>
		<p>One of the main concerns of the rover electronics was establishing RF connection through an impermeable surface, such as carbon fiber from the body tube, that could reach a range of 0.5 miles (launch field is 2500 ft in radius). Prior to testing the Tx/Rx and VTx/VRx pairs, the ability of the selected electronics to accomplish a minimum 0.5 mile radius was verified using the Friis Transmission Equation shown below:</p>
		<p>$$P_R= {P_T\ G_T\ G_R\ c^2} \over {(4\pi Rf)}^2 $$</p>
		<p>Where <i>P<sub>R</sub></i> is the received power in W, <i>P<sub>T</sub></i> is the power of the transmitter in W, <i>G<sub>T</sub></i> and <i>G<sub>R</sub></i> are the antenna gains of the transmitter and receiver respectively in dBi, <i>c</i> is the speed of light in m/s, <i>R</i> is the antenna separation in m, and <i>f</i> is the frequency in Hz. This equation assumes both antennas are in free space (i.e. no obstructions nearby).</p>
		<p>For the following calculations, both the transmitter and receiver will use the same TrueRC Singularity RHCP 2.4GHz antenna with a gain of 1.6dBi. Since the antennas are all the same polarization (RHCP), there is no need to consider the polarization loss factor. The desired radius is 0.5 miles which is ~804.7 meters. The sensitivity of each receiver is the minimum gain needed to fully receive a signal. A gain higher than that of the sensitivity indicates a successful transmission. Relevant transmitter and receiver parameters are tabulated below. Unit converions were made outside of the scope of the formula.</p>

		<p>Another verification step taken was a battery run-time analysis and current draw bottleneck analysis. Many of the electrical components passively draw small amounts of current while idle. During launch day, it is expected for a launch vehicle to be on the launch pad for no more than 2 hours. Since the launch vehicle design did not include an external switch to power the rover specifically, the team aimed to have a battery run-time of 4 hours for idling and 30 mins for completing the mission. The math for this is simple: current draw of components (mA) multiplied by the number of hours running (h) and compare the (mAh) needed vs how much the battery can supply. The following figure tabulates current draws of electrical components of the rover. Also provided in the table are the voltage ranges of electrical components to verify the selected battery is compatible with all onboard electronics.</p>

		<p>Using the mentioned 11.1V 3S 4000 mAh 50C LiPo battery, the battery exceeds the teams 4 hour and 30 minute idle and mission time requirement as this only draws up to 3485 mAh and the battery can supply 4000 mAh. The battery also supplies the appropriate voltages to high voltage components while the XT60 PDB steps down voltage for all other 5V logic components.</p>
		<p>Another important thing to note is the max current draw of the DC motors is up to 10.6A. While full throttle will never happen, it is important to consider how the system would react if this unlikely case were to occur. Each DC motor can draw up to 10.6A for a total current draw of 42.4A. The selected ESC is rated for 25A each DC motor, so no bottlenecking occurs. The LiPo battery selected is rated 50C at 4000 mAh, or 4 Ah. This means the LiPo battery can safely discharge up to 200A at once. The current draw of all electrical components at their max limit does not exceed the max discharge rate of the battery, so the system is more than capable for delivering all required voltages and currents.</p>
		<p>AND FINALLY, here are some pictures of an attempted test case of just the video RF feedback. The test was a huge failure as live video feedback was only able to be broadcast at a very short distance and lost connection almost immediately. This likely due to there being various electrical connections from Santa Monica's cliffs to the lifeguard towers which may interfere with the RF signal.</p>
