		<h1>What is this?</h1>
		<p>In 2019, Bearospace @ UCLA achieved <a href="rocket_project_2019.html">first place in NASA's First Nations Launch</a> (FNL). Following this success, Bearospace applied and was accepted to NASA Student Launch (formerly known as University Student Launch Initiative, or USLI). USLI is a research-based, competitive, high-powered rocketry competition focused primarily on developing unique payload systems. It strives to provide, relevant, cost-effective research and development of current objectives/problems faced by the Artemis program. Unlike FNL, USLI is not limited to minorities, nor does it provide funding for teams. USLI is a more competitive and higher caliber student project. I encourage you to read the <a href="#context&struggles">Context & Struggles</a> section to better understand the scope and effort USLI meant for the Bearospace team.</p>
		<h2>Relevant Requirements</h2>
		<p>This year's unique payload criteria was to design a system capable of being launched in a high power rocket, landing safely, and recovering simulated lunar ice from one of several locations on the surface of the launch field. Important high-level design requirements are presented below:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Five recovery areas will be located on the surface of the launch field. Teams may recover a sample from any of the recovery areas. Each recovery site will be at least 3 feet in diameter and contain sample material extending from ground level to at least 2 inches below the surface.</li>
			<li>The recovered ice sample will be a minimum of 10 milliliters (mL).</li>
			<li>Once the sample is recovered, it must be stored and transported at least 10 linear feet from the recovery area.</li>
			<li>Teams must abide by all FAA and NAR rules and regulations.</li>
			<li>Black Powder and/or similar energetics are only permitted for deployment of in-flight recovery systems. Any ground deployments must utilize mechanical systems.</li>
			<li>Any part of the payload or vehicle that is designed to be deployed, whether on the ground or in the air, must be fully retained until it is deployed as designed.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Additional general, vehicle, recovery, and safety requirements are outlined in the manual but are not as applicable to my role so they will not be discussed.</p>

		<h2>Grading</h2>
		<p>Grading for the competition was based on major milestone documents and deliverables in addition to physical launch vehicle objectives. Milestone deliverables (first 4 bullet points) include a report, presentation, and milestone proof of concept launches if applicable.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Preliminary Design Review (PDR) (20%)</li>
			<li>Critical Design Review (CDR) (20%)</li>
			<li>Flight Readiness Review (FRR) (20%)</li>
			<li>Post Launch Assessment Review (PLAR) (15%)</li>
			<li>Flight and Recovery (10%)</li>
			<li>Altitude (10%)</li>
			<li>STEM Engagement (5%)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Due to COVID-19, grading criteria that depended on physically building and launching the rocket were omitted from the competition.</p>

		<h1>My Roles & Tasks</h1>
		<p>Because of the extreme lack of members between the previous year and this year, I was formally known as both the electronics lead and the payloads lead. To some degree, this dual role made it easier to collaborate between the electronics and the payloads team since I was essentially both teams, but the workload was still twice as much. After recruiting freshman, I had a sizeable team of 5 on the electronics team but only me on the payloads team. Below is a snippet of the work I managed to complete before COVID-19 halted progress.</p>

		<h2>Payload</h2>
		<p>As the payloads lead, I was responsible for designing, manufacturing, and mechanically testing the payload and its associated deployment method. This meant a lot of SolidWorks, 3D printing, CNC milling and modifying commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components. Each dimension was iteratively modified during the R&D phase of manufacturing. As the only member of the payloads team, I spent almost all my time in the machine shop, either starting 3D prints or CNC milling wooden components.</p>
		<div class="w3-row">

		</div>
		<p>The payload design features two functional components:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The Rover Ejection Assembly (REA)</li>
			<li>The Rover</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The rover ejection assembly is tasked with retaining and deploying the rover in the correct orientation after a landing event has been identified. Once deployed, the payload will begin radio frequency communication with a driver on the ground. The rover will receive inputs from the driver and return video feedback to the driver to complete the mission.</p>
		<h3>Rover Ejection Assembly (REA)</h3>
		<div class="w3-row">
			<div class="w3-col l12 m12 s12">

		</div>
		<p>Using the above figure as reference, the leftmost stepper motor (1) is attached to a bulkhead (3) using epoxy. This stepper motor connects to the entire assembly to rotate the payload. Attaching the motor to the entire assembly makes the motor a load bearing component. A large moment will be induced on the stepper motor from the protruding rods and payload resting on the rods. To prevent this, an additional aluminum alloy bearing ring (4) will be used. The bearing ring will support the entire assembly so that the leftmost stepper motor will only rotate the assembly, not support it. All load bearing forces will be applied to the bearing ring. Since the purchased bearing ring is flat, additional 3D printed rings (2 & 6) are placed to offset one rotating ring from the other. These standoff rings interface with the bearing ring and the bulkhead or circular block holder (7). A circular tube (5) will fit around the shaft of the stepper motor and will be epoxied into the large circular block holder (7). The circular block holder acts as a rotating bulkhead for which to attach the rods and additional stepper motor onto. Cutouts for another stepper motor, a gyroscope/accelerometer module, and a steel rod are provided. The unthreaded rod (9) and stepper motor (1) will be epoxied into the designated hole inside the circular block holder. In order to attach the lead screw (10) onto the stepper motor, a 5mm to 10mm coupling (9) will be used. The coupling allows two shafts of different diameters to be attached by adjusting the force applied on each using screws. Both the lead screw and unthreaded rod are ⅜" in diameter to provide enough rigidity to support the weight of the payload.</p>
		<p>A unique aspect of the rover deployment mechanism is the circular block holder (7). Dimensions of each cut were dictated by the size of the stepper motor, interference with the eyebolt attached to the bulkhead, and size constraints imposed by the rover ebay. A concern with the shape of the circular block holder was its thin wall size for housing the stepper motor compromising the overall strength of the retention system and how protrusion of the stepper motor outside the boundary of the circular block holder outer diameter clashes with the eyebolt if driven the wrong way. The following figure demonstrates the reasoning for the circular block holder.</p>
		<div class="w3-row">
			<div class="w3-col l12 m12 s12">
				<img class="image-gal" style="max-width: 500px;" src="pictures/rocket20/Rotation Part.png">
			</div>	
		</div>
		<p>The diameter of the circular block holder allots space for the leftmost eyebolt (which is used for the launch vehicle's parachute), however, this means part of the stepper motor is exposed. If rotated counterclockwise, the stepper motor will interfere with the eyebolt, which jeopardizes the deployment mechanism’s ability to orient the rover. Moving the motor and shaft towards the center would mitigate this problem, but would limit the space available for electronics onboard the rover.</p>

		<h3>Rover</h3>

		<p>The payload features a 11.4" x 4.3" x 4.2" rover with a collapsible collection arm and antenna for storage within the launch vehicle. A 2.3" x 1.9" x 0.4" (~28.6mL) storage area within the chassis of the rover will store simulated lunar ice samples. The same collection arm doubles as a cap for the collection bin to ensure collected samples are retained within the rover during transportation. A separate 2.4" x 3.0" x 4.0" compartmentalized section, located on the back side of the rover, is dedicated to housing all onboard electronics. A requirement in the USLI handbook states that all lithium polymer batteries must be sufficiently protected and marked as flammable. To satisfy this requirement, the single lithium polymer battery powering onboard electronics is located in a separate, bright red compartment within the electronics bay. All other electronics are placed on the top half of the electronics bay for easier access to electronics. Both compartments and lid are fastened to each other using 6-32 nuts and bolts. The bottom red compartment of the ebay is attached to the chassis using epoxy. The contact area between the chassis and the bottom ebay compartment is maximized to increase the amount of epoxy applied between the two parts. The rover uses wheels instead of treads as its form of movement. While this limits the rover’s ability to overcome obstacles located under its center, the driver will take extra precaution in avoiding obstacles.</p>

		</div>
		<p>A crucial component for deploying the rover and managing electronics onboard the rover is the electronics bay (7 & 8). Since the electronics bay interfaces with the deployment mechanism’s rods, the electronics bay must support the weight of the rover and landing impact forces while stored within the launch vehicle. A custom printed female threaded rod (10) interfaces with the threaded rod of the REA. A small camera is mounted on top of the payload on component (9) for video feedback. Additional design considerations were utilized for all components but will be omitted for brevity.</p>
