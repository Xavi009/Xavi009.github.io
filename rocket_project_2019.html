		<div class="content-text">
			<p>Every year, NASA’s Wisconsin Space Grant Consortium (WSGC) hosts the annual First Nations Launch (FNL) National Rocket Competition.  This competition is an opportunity for students attending a Tribal College or University, or who are members of a campus AISES chapter, to design, build, and fly a rocket to be launched at a competition at the Richard Bong State Recreational Area in Kansasville, WI. The competition requires teams of undergraduate students to conceive, design, fabricate, and compete with high-powered rockets.</p>

		<h1>My Role</h1>
		<div class="content-text">
			<p>As the electronics lead, my main tasks were to ensure dual deployment occurred during flight and to satisfy the challenge portion of the competition. To efficiently use space in the rocket, all electronics were centralized into one electronics bay (a combination of the payload and avionics bay). For this reason, I was also tasked with designing and manufacturing a locking mechanism/bulkhead and an avionics sled to neatly house all electronics. Additionally, I hosted two Arduino workshops to teach incoming freshman hardware programming and peak club interest. The logistics of the general rocket design, financing, consolidating reports, and general management were handled by other leads.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="content-padding">
		<h1>The Locking Mechanism and Sled</h1>
		<div class="content-text">
			<p>The locking mechanism and sled attached the electronics to the rocket. The locking mechanism consisted of 2 main components (the outer and inner ring). The outer ring is epoxied to the body tube of the rocket and is shaped so that the inner ring can slide and lock into place. The sled, which snugly contains all electronics, is epoxied onto the inner ring of the locking mechanism. The inner ring also has an “eye-bolt” drilled in to fasten the shock cord to the rocket. Each ring was made using 2 layers of 0.75in thick pinewood which were CNC’d to the appropriate dimensions. The outer diameter of the outer ring was 3.8in to snugly fit into the 4in body tube. Originally, a rubber sheet was going to be attached on top of the inner ring to provide an airtight seal, but a lack of communication between me and team member scrapped the idea.</p>
			<p>The sled of the avionics bay was the most problematic since it was a matter of space management and prototyping. The sled features a 10.9in long T-Shape 3D printed fitting with a flat end for increased surface area and  adhesion to the inner ring. The sled fits 2 altimeters, 3 9V batteries, an Arduino Uno, an MPU6050, and a BMP180 module. The 9V batteries are enclosed with custom made 9V battery holders. Due to space limitations, the Arduino Uno had to have its standard rails desoldered and all connections were soldered directly to the board. The MPU6050 and BMP180 were located on the opposite side of the Arduino Uno, so cable management was essential.</p>

		<h1 id="payload">The Payload</h1>
		<div class="content-text">
			<p>To solve the challenge, the following electronics were incorporated in the payload: an Arduino Uno, a MPU6050 Gyroscope/accelerometer module, a BMP180 Pressure Sensor, an SD Card Module, and a 9V battery. Although the challenge only requires 3 data types, 5 data types were acquired in case of individual component failure in a module. These components formed what is known as the payload of the rocket.</p>

			<p>The following wiring schematic was adopted. Since both the MPU6050 and BMP180 used I2C buses to communicate with the microcontroller, data was captured from both devices using the same pins.

		<h2>Acquiring Data</h2>
		video/gif of real-time data
		<div class="content-text">
			<p>After launch, various data points were obtained and were exported onto an SD Card. Since data types were delineated by a comma, data could be separated in excel for analysis. Unfortunately, since both data modules were controlled using the same two pins, data gathering was not fast enough for a high speed launch. Additionally, turbulence during the flight rendered the MPU6050 useless due to the module’s high sensitivity. The following graphs display clear trends for data types gathered by the BMP180, but not the MPU6050. Due to lack of time, the MPU6050 was taped onto the avionics sled, which meant the XYZ-axis were not centered properly, so G-force values are incorrect.</p>

			<p>Overall the payload performed decently. If I could change something, I would omit the MPU6050 and gather a different data type, such as pressure at the nosecone vs pressure at the fins. Or I would try and find a way to make the MPU6050 less sensitive and take averages to prevent scattered data points for rotation values.</p>

		<h1>Avionics Bay</h1>
		<div class="content-text">
			<p>The avionics bay consisted of two altimeters and two 9V batteries as well as the payload. One of the most crucial objectives of the rocket is to safely recover the rocket. This action was operated by the altimeters. Altimeters read temperature and pressure data to determine altitude. Once a desired altitude was reached, the altimeter would send a charge to an ejection charge, which would cause a controlled explosion within the rocket and a parachute would deploy.</p>
			<p>Two altimeters were used for redundancy. In case the primary altimeter failed and did not send a signal to the ejection charges, a 2nd altimeter would do the same process. The primary altimeter used was a Missile Works RRC3 Sport Altimeter (RRC3) and the redundant altimeter was a Perfect Flite StratoLogger SL100 Altimeter (SL100). The main altimeter was programmed to deploy the drogue chute at apogee and the main chute at 500 ft above ground level. The redundant altimeter was programmed to deploy with a 3 second delay. A drogue chute was used to decrease descent time without descending too fast and the main chute would further slow the rocket for a safe landing. Click <a  class="text-ref" href="rocket_project_altimeters.html"><b>here</b></a> to learn more about programming the altimeters.</p>
			<p>The use of switches not only makes powering the electronics bay easier, but it reduces the amount of energy used by reducing idle time. Using Anderson Powerpole Connector Pins allowed the electronics bay to be wired and positioned in the rocket and placed on the launch vehicle without powering anything. Once ready for flight, the switches were connected to power all electronics. A total of 3 switches were used; one for each altimeter and one for the Arduino Uno. Since the Arduino has no pins dedicated for switches, the ground of the battery was attached to the switch. The following wiring schematic was used:</p>
